# Welcome to Objection.lol Projects Compilation

Here, I tried to archive open source(and some projects with no open source license but forked) projects made about objection.lol for easier access and listing. 

If you want to suggest a project, please send an email to erdaloz065@gmail.com

You can suggest your own projects.

I will list non program projects too.

**Some projects do not have licenses, which means you can't use code or art or music created by the person without their permission, read more here: https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/ **
